## Android Workshop - Student Dev Days 2013 ##

This project contains material for the Android Workshop at Student Dev Days 2013, organized by the Goa Android User Group on March 23, 2013.

The material is good enough for anyone who wants to self-study writing Android applications. 

The material assumes the following:

- Basic knowledge of Java language
- Familiarity with Eclipse tools

Even if you do not have the expertise in the above tools, be patient and follow the material and within no time you will be set writing Android apps. It can't be that difficult... right?

##Setup your Development Environment##
Before you begin, it helps to have your development environment setup. Luckily, the Android release team does a great job in packaging a bundle that eases your setup process. 

I have put down a brief set of instructions in the `hands-on-exercises` folder, titled `Android Dev Environment Setup.docx` that you should get you all set with getting your environment ready for Android development. At a high level, it is just two steps:

- Install a Java Development Kit (6x or 7x) is fine.
- Install the Android Development Toolkit (ADT) for your system

So without much ado, your first stop here should be the `hands-on-exercises` folder and the `Android Dev Environment Setup.docx` file.

##Navigating the Material##
The material contains the following folders:

- `AndroidStudentDevDays-March-2013-MindStormSoftware.pptx` : This is the main presentation material. Follow it and at the appropriate slides, I will refer to the Hands on exercises, that you should try out and which are all present in the `hands-on-exercises` folder
- `hands-on-exercises` : There are a total of 6 hands-on exercises that are referenced at the right place in the presentation above.
- `projects` - This folder contains various Android projects that are built as part of the hands-on-exercises. Ideally if you follow the hands-on exercises and do them, you will not need these. But these projects are given here, so that you can simply import them into your Eclipse Workspace should you need them. 

##Questions##
Please write to me at romin.irani@mindstormsoftware.com, if you have any questions regarding this material. I will try my best to answer your queries via email. When writing to me, help me help you by giving me as much detail about what you are trying to do, error log, screenshot, etc. so that I can get you the correct answers.

Emails that say begin and end with the line "It is not working" are likely to get a gentle smile from me but no specific response.

All the Best in getting started with Android. Go forth and bring your ideas to reality. May a million Android Apps bloom !
